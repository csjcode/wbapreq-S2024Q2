# WBA PREREQS

wbapreq-S2024Q2

Prerequisites: Enrollment dApp

READ CAREFULLY ALL STEPS

(NOTE-If you are a windows user, you will want to work in WSL2 for Solana)
These prerequisites are meant to assess your ability to follow process, execute tasks, debug
simple errors (intentionally placed), and ship code. They are not a test of your typescript or
coding skills. It is integral that you UNDERSTAND what is happening every step of the way.
This is a foundational process that we jump right into building upon in week one of the cohort.
As always, when in doubt- after trying for a minute- ask in the Solana Chat channel of the
Discord. If this is beyond your capacity at the moment, we will help you find the right program to
better prepare you for a future cohort.

Now we start- you will:
● Learn how to use @solana/web3.js to create a new keypair
● Use our Public Key to airdrop ourselves some Solana devnet tokens

● Use our WBA Private Key to enroll in the WBA enrollment dApp
